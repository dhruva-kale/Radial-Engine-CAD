# Radial-Engine-CAD Files for SolidWorks

## Overview

Welcome to the "Radial Engine Assemble" GitHub repository! This project provides a comprehensive collection of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files specifically designed for SolidWorks, enabling you to explore, study, and assemble a radial engine with precision. Whether you are a hobbyist, engineer, or student, these SolidWorks-compatible CAD files offer a detailed and accurate representation of a radial engine.

## Key Features

- **SolidWorks Compatibility:** High-quality, meticulously designed CAD files in native SolidWorks format (SLDPRT, SLDASM), ensuring seamless integration with SolidWorks for a smooth design and assembly process.

- **Detailed Components:** Each component of the radial engine is individually modeled, providing an in-depth understanding of the assembly process.

- **Educational Resource:** Ideal for educational purposes, the CAD files serve as a valuable resource for learning about radial engines, mechanical design, and assembly techniques.

## Getting Started
